Unrealistic startup projects just for learning bash scripting &amp; python ML modelling

Send The Tree is a fictional early-stage app whose single feature lets users send digital “trees” to friends. There’s also a paid option: after one free “Super Tree,” each additional Super Tree costs $1. Launched six months ago (with data tracking since month 1), the platform’s daily metrics have risen from ~100 new sign-ups and 300 tree-sends to ~1,800 sign-ups and 16,000 tree-sends. The company’s CEO believes users will pay for Super Trees; your task is to use the raw data to determine—without guesswork—whether that assumption holds and whether the current growth signals a healthy direction.
